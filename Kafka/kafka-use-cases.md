Top Kafka Use Cases

Kafka started as a tool for log processing but grew into much more. It stores messages until they expire and lets systems read data at their own pace.

Here are the main ways companies use Kafka today:

• Log Analysis: Collects logs from different services and sends them to tools like Elasticsearch for review

• Recommendation Systems: Streams user clicks and behavior to help create personalized recommendations

• System Monitoring: Watches service health and sends alerts when things go wrong

• Change Data Capture: Tracks database changes and keeps different systems in sync

• System Migration: Helps move from old to new systems by handling data flow between versions
